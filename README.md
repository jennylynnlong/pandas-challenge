Jennifer Long's Pandas Homework ReadMe file

I've chosen to complete the Heroes of Pymoli panda challenge. 

In this repository you will find the ipynb that includes all of the code for the assignment as well as text for observable trends.

I have also included my observable trends here:

1) Even though there are more males that play the game, females had a higher average purchase. It would be wise of the company to target the females in the game in an attempt to increase profits.
2) The age group of 20-24 year olds is the highest amount of players. Targeting them, the age group under 10 years old, and the age group 35-39 year olds would be profitable for the company as they have the highest average purchase price as well as average total purchase per person amount.
3) Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the top two most popular items. If the company increased the cost of these items (even slightly), they would see an increase in profits.
